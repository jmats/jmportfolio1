  <h6>In 2015, a group of food lovers came together to reimagine the dish discovery experience. This is my story of designing and managing Caper -  an iOS app that helps food lovers find new, exciting dishes and empowers local purveyors to share their craft while growing their community of “regulars.”</h6>

  <h2>CHALLENGE<br>_<br></h2>
    <br>
    <h4>
    A better way to discover dishes and a friendlier food platform for local purveyors
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p>
    With the explosion of the food-on-demand industry, Caper was born to combat late deliveries, overpriced portions, and the ever growing sea of underwhelming menu options. We believe quality meals in NYC should be easy to find (curated for discovery), affordable (fast-casual price point), and a short walk away (pick-up only to eliminate delivery fees and drive foot-traffic into the restaurant). We also love small, local businesses and want them to succeed.
    <br><br>
    Our challenge was to enter the highly competitive on‐demand food industry and provide an alternative way to find exciting food by anticipating of the evolution of user behavior - a shift towards mindful consumption, a desire to combat decision-fatigue when faced with overwhelming menu choices, and a backlash to the outrageous and ever-rising food-delivery fees. We also wanted to provide an alternative for jaded restaurants (local purveyors) who are tired of using other 3rd-party platforms charging exorbitant middle-man fees. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>
    What We Inherited
    </h4>
    <br>
    <p>
    Before the New York office was established, the co-founders and an overseas dev team had already started building the earliest version of our app without prior market or user research on our target demographic. Upon seeing the app, we realized immediately we would need to make adjustments specific to the New York market. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <img src="images/challengeinherited.png"/><br><br>
    <p>
    With our time constraint in mind, we did as much guerilla testing and made as many adjustments as time allowed so we could get a minimal viable product out for closed-beta testing in front of real users. The result is <a href="#">Caper v 1.0</a>, currently available on the App Store.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Our Goals</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
    With a small round of angel funding, Caper had enough runway to rapidly research, prototype, test, and build Caper v 2.0 in preparation for a public beta launch. We needed to:
    <br><br>
    <div class="goals"><p>(1) Start from the beginning and fully understand the user demographics (diners and purveyors) through extensive research and testing, and
    <br><br>(2) Iterate on user feedback to remove, improve, or design additional features for our public beta launch</p></div>
    </p>

  <h2>APPROACH<br>_<br></h2><br>
  <h4>The Discovery Phase</h4><br>
    <h5>HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT TO EAT?</h5><br>
    <p>
    The discovery phase was rapid and constrained to a two-week period, allowing us to define project goals, assess existing features, understand our competitors, uncover user behaviors, needs, and pain-points. To start, we needed to get into the perspective of our users to fully understand their habits and who they are. We wanted to learn, through our user survey, the following:
    </p><br>
    <ul>
      <li>User eating habits during the weekdays and the weekends: how often do they cook at home or order in</li><br>
      <li>What technologies are used to order in and what pain points exist in these platforms</li><br>
      <li>Dish discovery patterns: how often do users try new dishes and what prompts them to try a new dish</li><br>
      <li>What role does their mood play in influencing dish selection</li><br>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Our research revealed that mood, habit, and time constraints play a big role in eating habits. Price is a major pain point in ordering out, which reinforces our goal of curating for dishes within the fast-casual price range. Our curation algorithm will need to be robust so it can learn and display the most relevant dishes from the user’s order history, taste profile (long-term food preferences), and daily mood. Dish offerings should include photos, descriptions, and recommendations from trustworthy sources (e.g. people from within the user’s network) as well as main ingredients and allergens information. Delivery is a feature that users are used to, but they are also frustrated by the additional fees, how long it takes, and the diminished quality of the food when it arrives.

    <a href="#" class="btn" id="surveybtn">VIEW SURVEY RESULTS ></a><br><br>
    <h5>USER EMPATHY</h5><br>
    <p>
    To dig deeper into the minds of our users, we conducted interviews with testing participants, colleagues, stakeholders (investors and purveyors), and friends. We also shifted through existing feedback and pain points from our closed-beta testing of Caper v1.0. Through this, we gained valuable insight into our user’s needs and it gave us a greater understanding of their attitude towards our proposed solution. We designated two main persona archetypes and constantly referred back to them throughout the cycle of the project to ensure that we stayed true and accountable to our users. Through careful analysis of our research, we identified these variables to segment our target user base of millennials and young professionals: time constraint, cost, and variety of available dishes.

    <a href="#" class="btn" id="personabtn">SEE PERSONAS ></a><br><br>
    <h5>UNDERSTAND THE COMPETITION</h5><br>
    <p>
    The 3rd party food on-demand industry is extremely competitive, and although Caper is a unique model, we conducted market research and did a competitive analysis to understand our user’s pain points as well as the major strengths and weakness of similar companies in our field.

    <p>Armed with the above knowledge, we felt confident moving forward into the next phase of developing our product.</p>

<section class="approach2 container">
  <h4>Structure the Experience</h4><br>
  <p>
  With an better understanding of our potential users and competitors in the market, I created user stories to guide and prioritize product features. I put together user flows to visualize their end-to-end experience and also put together user flows describe how they would interact with the app.

  <a href="#" class="btn" id="flowsbtn">VIEW USER FLOWS ></a><br><br>
  <p class="contentclear">
  By synthesizing all of our research results, we were able to extract requirements for the next version of our app, helping us understand what existing functionality and content would be useful, what new features should be included and what needed to be removed. I created a spreadsheet that demonstrated what features currently exist in the private-beta product and what needed to exist in the next iteration of Caper.

<section class="approach3">
<div class="approach3 container">
  <h4>Polishing Our Identity</h4><br>
  <p>
  To clearly communicate the personality of our app, we worked around this set of experience principles:<br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Eliminate decision fatigue</li>
    <li>Build a community and humanize the eating experience again</li>
    <li>Promote purveyor stories</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  The company was originally incorporated under the name “Kichin,” but after a quick surveying of strangers and friends, we wanted to change our name to something that was less generic and had more personality. We hired an external designer for the final logo design and gave him the following parameters:  we are “quirky, playful, and fun” and a team brainstorming session yielded the name “Caper,” which means “lively or playful” but also has the dual meaning as the name of a food item.  For typography, I chose the clean, minimalistic <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Muli">Muli</a> by Vernon Adams, paired with the beautiful <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora">Lora</a> by Cyreal.

  <h4 class="contentclear">The Framework</h4><br>
    <h5>WIREFRAMES & SKETCHES</h5><br>
    <p>
    With the results of our research to guide us, our goals for Caper v 2.0 were threefold - first, we needed to address the pain point of navigation opaqueness brought up by our beta-testers. Survey and interview results revealed weakness and inefficiency in the placement of the sidebar menu and back-button in Caper v 1.0, so we set out to find a better solution for our navigation system. Second, since curation is the crux of our model, we needed to make it clear to our users that we are selecting four dishes for them based on their input. Third, using our research results as a guide, we needed to build and test these additional features: creating a Taste Profile, saving favorite dishes and purveyors, building a search function, and entering a custom location address. With these goals in mind, I began sketching and exploring different navigation patterns, moving rapidly from sketches to building low-fidelity prototype on InVision.

   <img src="images/wireframe1.png"/>

  <a href="#" class="btn" id="wireframebtn">VIEW WIREFRAMES ></a>
    <h5>TEST EARLY & TEST OFTEN</h5><br>
    <p>
    To address the opaqueness of Caper v 1.0’s navigation, we revisited menu items, trimming features down to the essentials and experimented between the sidebar menu and the standard iOS navigation bar. However, early guerilla testing results indicated that the standard iOS navigation bar was equally confusing for our users. A second, deeper look indicated that a lot of the menu items did not need to be placed out in the open since it adds unnecessary distraction to the flow of the app. Thus, we shifted these secondary functions back into the sidebar menu with one significant change - we limited the menu’s accessibility. By displaying the sidebar menu only on select screens, we cleared up our navigation flows and mitigated the confusion of our users greatly.<br><br>
    Armed with these testing results from my low-fidelity wireframes, I now had a stronger foundation of how users would move through Caper. Using Sketch and InVision, I built a high-fidelity, interactive prototype that was now ready for additional usability testing.
